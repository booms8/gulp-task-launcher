# Atom gulp-task-launcher

Automatically locates a gulpfile.[js|coffee] and displays the tasks. Tasks can be executed manually or a default run-on-launch task can be specified.

Toggle with 'ctrl-alt-g'

Notes:
 - Executing a task automatically terminates any already running task
 - Toggle off before quitting Atom, otherwise running gulp processes will be orphaned
